# GAT150-2: Electric Boologaloo

This repository contains my final project for **GAT150-2**.  
It demonstrates my understanding of C++ programming fundamentals, object-oriented design, and game/engine concepts covered throughout the course.

---

## 📜 Overview

This project is a culmination of everything I’ve learned this semester, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Dynamic memory management
- File I/O
- Classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Game loop and update/draw systems
- Use of external libraries or frameworks (if applicable)

*(Add a one-sentence description of your project’s theme, e.g., “This is a simple 2D game where you control a character and collect points.”)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++ (C++17 or higher)
- **IDE/Compiler:** Visual Studio 2022 (or specify another)
- **Dependencies:** None (or list any libraries like SDL2, SFML, etc.)
